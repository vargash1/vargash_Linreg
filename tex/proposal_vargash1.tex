I propose to do a project involving linear regression with the fertility data set(link below). I want to see if there is a correlation between: fertility rate(success) and a few of the varibles given in the data set(alcohol compsumption, hours spent sitting down, recent fever). \par

Due to shiny being interactive, the user could select some reasonable value for the following varibles and see if there would be any correlation. Example: User is curious whether a woman sits x hours per day, thanks to the interactivity of shiny then the use could input the x value and it would be calculated rather than having some fixed value as we did on the HW regarding Amelia's bone.\par  

Please let me know of any concerns, reccomendations.
